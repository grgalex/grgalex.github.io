I am a doctoral candidate at the [Department of Business Administration](https://ba-en.uoa.gr/)
of the [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/),
under the supervision of Assistant Professor [Dimitris Mitropoulos](https://dimitro.gr/).

I'm also a Systems Architect at the [Greek National Infrastructures for Research and Technology (GRNET)]
(https://grnet.gr/en/).

My research lies at the intersection of systems and software,
with a focus on improving the reliability of computer systems
as well as the utilization of traditional and heterogenous
computational resources.

I'm currently working on improving
the reliability of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) software.

Before joining the University of Athens,
and after finishing my undergraduate studies
in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en).
I was a Systems/Software Engineer at Arrikto for 2 years,
where I focused on ML systems.

You can find a short CV [here](./assets/pdf/grgalex_cv.pdf).
