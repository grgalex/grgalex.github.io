I am a doctoral candidate at the [Department of Business Administration](https://ba-en.uoa.gr/)
of the [University of Athens](https://en.uoa.gr/),
under the supervision of Assistant Professor [Dimitris Mitropoulos](https://dimitro.gr/).
I also work as a Systems Architect at the [Greek National Infrastructures for Research and Technology (GRNET)](https://grnet.gr/en/).
Before joining the University of Athens,
and after finishing my undergraduate studies
in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en),
I was a Systems/Software Engineer at [Arrikto](https://www.arrikto.com/),
where I focused on ML systems.

You can find a short CV [here](./assets/pdf/grgalex_cv.pdf).

My research lies at the intersection of systems and software,
with a focus on improving the reliability of computer systems
as well as the utilization of traditional and heterogenous
computational resources.

I'm currently trying to improve
the reliability of Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) software.
